## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS3 Rules - Media Queries for Responsiveness
- Mobile-first approach

### What I learned

- I got to improve on working with background images in CSS
- I learnt about form validation; includes email, password, etc.

<!-- ```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
``` -->

### Continued development

I intend to focus more on implementing Vanilla JavaScript in projects to improve my problem-solving skills.

### Useful resources

- [JavaScript Crash Course Video - Brad Traversy](https://youtu.be/hdI2bqOjy3c) - This helped me with Use of Events in DOM, like Event Delegation. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.

- [JavaScript Form Validation](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/javascript-dom/javascript-form-validation/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand Form Validation with JavaScript. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
